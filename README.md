Depravity LM had an issue with regards to crashing on load in 4.01+. As such I took it upon myself to look through the files, find the root cause and fix it, which I have done now

A simple tweak to the .csv as well as the .w2w file and the mod is working correctly now on 4.01+. No other files were touched

# Installation
Extract and place modDepravityLightingMod and dlcSerenityTookClouds in your respective dlc and mod folders

# Uninstallation
Remove modDepravityLightingMod and dlcSerenityTookClouds

# Compatibility
This mod will come into conflict with any other Lighting Mod that also edits Velen/Novigrad. If you are planning on using a whole lighting mod overhaul along with Depravity, then make sure Depravity has priority
